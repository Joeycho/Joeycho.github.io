Why should I choose the software development in my career?

Frist of all, it was inevitable to learn interacting with digital world. For me, I also was raised with computer games, as number one hobby in teenager age, and we started to make profile in SNS, and move around the services, which is popular and support the group, which I belong in. But then, it touched my limited creativtiy, and I was orginally loved or interested in Math and Science. Since they have universal and truthful characters by themselves. It always gave me a hope and chance to communicate with everyone and work with everyone. Sometimes they awaken me with the astonishing truth and facts. 

However, I realized they reached the end in hypothetical way, and there were always discussion in how they are practical in our life and affect our life. From that point, I started to embrace other academic area, such as humanities, philosophy, religion, and so on. World is still very complicated, and I noticed there are a lot of problems, which need to be solved. And for me, software has amazing power to solve them and it looks quite frontier to solve the problems. So, I decided to join in the world of software, and that's how I choose my major as computer science. 

Obviously, sometimes I feel drained out in my brain when I coded or implemented something(Not in the code, but when I lose my way in debugging), and it really makes me nothing and invaluable. that's why sometime I try to keep the code away from me. But in bigger love, I noticed that the app was developed for the services, and I saw they really changed the world and how people think of the world. There were a lot of debates, which talks about the direction of this development, but I assure that this tendency will not be stopped and continue evolving in some way.

The world is changed. The flow of people, traveling around the world, become more common thesedays, and this makes it possible for people to find their own purpose, or their meaning of life. This reduce the stereotypes between nations, and sometimes even resolve the misunderstanding between people. That's very amazing, compared to the past time.

Still, many startup companies start their business with web platform, even major companies also keep invest a lot of assets on developing and structuring IT platform for the companies. That's how powerful software is.

So, It's inevitable, and has fascinating aspects of the world.

Now, the questions should be what should I focus on in software development? How can I find those skills? and How should I learn those things? and How can we incorporate them with our life?

I choose to learn skills to be full-stack web developer, and I'm sure that it will help me feel more confident in the web-world, and be free since it will enable me to do lots of things.
