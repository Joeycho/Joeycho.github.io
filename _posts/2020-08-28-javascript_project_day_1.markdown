I have thought that I want to update my blog homepage and have more control of it.

From this motivation, I decided to do my project, which adds commenting functionality in each blog page.

So far, Backend part would save the comments data, and Frontend(blog webpage) would render the comments every time.

In Day 1,

I am struggling to resolve Jekyl integration into Rails, so-called Jekyl on Rails.

Now, I am refering,

https://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-rails/

and I confronted 'webpacker issue' and 'yarn installing issue' in running 'rails server',

In 'yarn' installing process, https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable,

I confronted 'gpg' failure issues, so I had to reinstall with other version of 'gpg', as the following,

I am still stuck in Jekyll on top of Rails...
