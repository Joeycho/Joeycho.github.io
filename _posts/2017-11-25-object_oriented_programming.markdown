Recently, with a good luck, I've started to teach a teenager student p5js to help him make a game. He already has concrete and realizable plan to make it. So, all I did for him was be a coach to guide him to go forward. Since in his code he tried to code everything one by one for each elements, I suggested him to move on the other structure, which is easy to change the number of elements. That's how I started realizing how effective the object oriented programming is.

With object oriented style, I feel that it's getting more important to design the program. If it's not well planned before, code could easily be mixed and confused between procedure style and OOs. It really does not help the programmer, and even it discourage to keep doing it. So, I think it's better to start with the simple test code in procedure style, and start to build it in OOs. That's how understand to make it in a guided way. 

I will be more trained with Object oriented style, but until now, I've enjoyed learning new terms and ideas in this style. It's fun to learn the difference between object and class. And constructor function and class thing. The course drove me to have interest in ES2015(I just googled it, and it's same as ES6) to understand class in Javascript. It's good to read all of them.
