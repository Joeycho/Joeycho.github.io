To put it simply, what is my tech history? and where am I in the journey?

I'm not sure that which name is the most cool and accurate name to call us, but obviously computer science is one of the best terms to embrace all of skills and technology along its history. Before the internet came to us, computer existed, and it was usually developed and researched by scientist in academic area. But now, in 2017, absolutely, it exists everywhere.

In my case, as I acclaimed in the preivous post, I was just a student, who like and a slightly better at math and science. But I was not full in those areas. Since I also had interest in social phenomenon , and sometime I really wantted to engage in the issues to make them better or to be resolved in a good way. So, computer science seemed so cool to deal with everything, and I chose to study it.

So, computer science started with me from 2011, when I entered the university. First language which I confronted was C language. And the school required me to code and practice it in linux envrionment with a text editor, Vi. That was very raw, but I thought that it was good way to learn the skill with background knowledge. Now I agree with that C is better with Unix environment, but overall C is not modern computer language anymore. it will be effective to code for hardware, and environmental software, such as OS, compiler, Database. It's not practical anymore for the most interesting and highly productive area, such as the startup company, normal website, and interface with users.

That's why I was lost for a while, and started to look for new way to develop my web development skill, and I met Flatiron school. Since I had exerience to learn coding with books and googling for C, Java, and C++. I was really fascinated the all courses which are offfered by the school, and I really appreciated them how much they guide me in a right and good way. So, all that matter from me could be the time management, and make time for learning in Flatiron school, and I could settle down with the obscure anxiety.

However, at the same time, I also realized that there is another boosting up in Data Science among the companies, and authorities, it's getting important to learn and understand how to deal with the data processing with computer science. That's why I also touched Python, and now I learned several computing algorithms and techniques inspired from nature and biology. It really helped me to see the core algorithm skills that are also related with the nature. it happens, the integration inside me.

Where are you, people? How is your history with all these skills, and computing thing?

I really appreciate that nowadays, we could meet in Slack, Stackoverflow, and Github. And they are really going well in a professional way. We could keep learn and be connected well. And learn platform, No words. It deserves to be the curriculum to replace the regular education system. Still so stunning, and mind-blowing place in web and most importantly among people which has similar interest and help each other!! I got so much help from Q&A. And they are always nice to help me. It really keep me to be postive and be going on the track.

Keep learning, and oneday finish all curriculum, and I could be confident with all I learn.
