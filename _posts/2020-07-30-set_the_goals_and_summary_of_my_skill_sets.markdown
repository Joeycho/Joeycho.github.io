I have learned in Flatiron School since 2017. 

In 2017, I was in US just after my military service in South Korea. I was about to study in Oslo as exchange student. I was deviated for a while, since I thought that is privilege for bachelor students. Of course, some student are quite firm for their goals and interest, but we can still change our major and choose other subject as well. Anyway, I was deviated, but I want to keep practicing my coding along the journey. in C, C++, I cannot feel joy or elegance in them. I want to feel comforable with any language, and Flatiron School guided me very well with Ruby and all useful tech stack.

In 2017, I knew C, Java, C++, and some Android programming. Flatiron School taught me Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and the most important thing is the fundamental of web development. I really appreciate that other platform, such as Angular JS, has also similar structure as Rails, so called, Model, View, and Controller structure. This concept brought me student jobs later.

In 2017 and 2018, I learned Neural Network, multi-layer Perceptron in Oslo and it made me have a motivation to learn Python and Data Science in general. This guided me to finish my bachelor thesis project with Tensorflow.js in 2019.

In 2019 Fall, I finally started to study in TUM, Munich. I was exposed to Computer Vision, and Machine Learning intensively and in theoretical way, so now I understand briefly that which topics are in Computer Vision and what is discussed in both areas.I started to feel comfortable with Pytorch rather than Tensorflow.

In short,

1. Matlab for CV
2. Typescript, Javascript, Python for web development
3. Read and review papers in CVPR, ICCV, ECCV
4. review and self-study the past and not-attended courses, such as Variational Method, ADLCV, CV3DT etc.
5. maybe write a post in a week, regarding the research, study, life.. whatever.
